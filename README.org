A shell command to quickly kill off all the unnecessary browser tabs one accumulates.

Works on Macs with Chrome, Brave, and maybe other Chrome-derived browsers.

Uses the [[https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo][Lumo ClojureScript environment]]: first project I've done with that, it's pretty sweet! No more long startup times! The previous version of this was in JVM-based Clojure and was basically unusable.
